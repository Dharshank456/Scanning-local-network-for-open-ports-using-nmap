Port 53 is used for DNS services, but leaving it open can expose a network to several security risks.

Security Risks of Open Port 53
DNS Tunneling: Attackers may hide data in DNS requests, using port 53 to exfiltrate sensitive information. This often bypasses basic firewall rules since DNS traffic is typically allowed.
DDoS and Reflection Attacks: Open DNS servers can be abused in Distributed Denial of Service attacks, reflecting amplified traffic to target victims.
DNS Cache Poisoning/Spoofing: Attackers can insert false DNS records, redirecting users to malicious sites.
Botnet Control: Some malware uses DNS queries through port 53 for command and control communication with infected devices.

Best Practices
Restrict access to DNS port 53â€”allow only necessary and trusted networks or systems to query your DNS server.
Implement firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and monitor for anomalous patterns in DNS traffic.
Use security extensions like DNSSEC, enable DNS over HTTPS (DoH), and keep DNS software updated
